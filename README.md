## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you find a bug in Threema for desktop, feel free to start a new thread in the
[unofficial community forum](https://threema-forum.de/index.php?board/23-bugs-und-fehlermeldungen/)
or contact
[support](https://threema.ch/en/request/default?i_have_read_the_faq=1).

Please note that we are already working on a
[new architecture for Threema for desktop](https://threema.ch/en/blog/posts/md-architectural-overview-intro)
and have already taken many feature requests into account. The new solution will
allow Threema for desktop to send and receive messages even when the associated
phone is offline.

## Development

Threema for desktop is built on top of the existing
[Threema Web project](https://github.com/threema-ch/threema-web) and
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org).

To build Threema for desktop, follow the steps below.

**Step 0: Ensure that Git submodules are checked out**

    git submodule update --init

**Step 1: Build Threema Web**

    export DEV_ENV=development
    export threema_web_version=threema-web-2.5.1
    npm install
    ./tools/patches/patch-threema-web.sh
    npm run app:build:web
    ./tools/patches/post-patch-threema-web.sh

**Step 2: Set the target configuration**

Export the `TARGET_OS` and `TARGET_ID` env variables:

| OS      | Package Type | $TARGET_OS | $TARGET_DIST | $TARGET_PKG       |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| macOS   | DMG          | macOS      | macos        | macos:dmg         |
| macOS   | ZIP          | macOS      | macos        | macos:zip         |
| Linux   | DEB          | linux-deb  | linux:deb    | linux:deb         |
| Linux   | RPM          | linux-deb  | linux:rpm    | linux:rpm         |
| Windows | EXE          | windows    | windows      | windows:installer |

For example, for a macOS DMG:

    export TARGET_OS=macOS
    export TARGET_DIST=macos
    export TARGET_PKG=macos:dmg

**Step 3: Package Threema Web into Electron**

    npm run app:install
    node tools/patches/post-patch-threema-web.js $TARGET_OS consumer
    npm run electron:dist:$TARGET_DIST:consumer
    npm run electron:package:$TARGET_PKG:consumer

The built app can be found in `app/build/dist-electron/packaged`.
